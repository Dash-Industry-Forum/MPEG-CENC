# MPEG-CENC

Discusses issues on MPEG Common Encryption

For adaptive streaming with CMAF as well as for browser-based playback of encrypted content, ISO/IEC 23001-7 Common Encryption has become the defacto standard. But continuous problems exist.

The issues will be discussed as part of the DASH-IF Content Protection and Security group together with the CTA WAVE experts.

Agreed issues will be forwarded to MPEG to be addressed as part of ISO/IEC 23001-7 as well as part of CMAF.
